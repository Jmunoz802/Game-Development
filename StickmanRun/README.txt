Stickman Run (tentative)
============
Originally I came up with the idea of trying to do a 2D thriller, where the player would have limited
sight of the environment based on a flashlight. While I was trying my hand at 2D animations in Unity,
I was reminded of a game I had played previously called "Canabalt" by Adam Atomic.
Link to the game and his website: http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/

Inspired by Canabalt, I began to do a procedurally generated running endurance game. In this 1-button
game, you jump from platform to platform trying to last as long as possible while the speed of the
platforms ramps up as time passes.

The visuals are incredibly simple and lacking as I haven't thought of a fitting theme/world for the game.
