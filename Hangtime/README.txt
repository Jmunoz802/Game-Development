Hangtime
--------------------------------------------------------
This is a 3rd-person platforming adventure game in the setting of a fantasy surrealistic world.
You are a treasure hunter off the coast of an island. During a freak accident you are tossed
overboard, wearing your diving suit, into the depths of the ocean. You wake up by the sounds
of a mysterious spirit and in front of ruins to a lost city. That is when your adventure begins.

This project spanned ~15 weeks during the semester in the 3D Capstone game development program
at the University of Texas at Austin (GAMMA). We started as a team of 6 but about a month in, the lead design
dropped the class and left the group for us to picked up the pieces, and that we did. We came together
after losing a member and overhauled the game to catch up to our classmates. One of the key features to
Hangtime is the dynamic sound that is created with the help of the Wwise sound engine integration
with Unity3D.

Team Consists of:
--------------------------------------------------------
Tyler Pixley - Scrum Master and Frontend Programmer
Josan Munoz(myself) - Backend Programmer
Nicole Fastow - Animator and 3D-Modeller
John Dodson - Artist and 3D-Modeller
Rob Luckfield - Lead Design and Audio Artist

Agile Development:
--------------------------------------------------------
One of the methods we used to develop our game was Agile. This method consists of short and fast Sprints
of development where we put out a build every sprint, in our case each week. From these builds we 
playtest for bugs, have a retrospective meeting where we reflect on what went well, what we can improve
upon and what is out of our scope. Furthermore we used Jira to track all our issues, bugs, features, and
improvements over each week in an organized and central fashion. Another part of agile development is the
notion of Scrums, a ~15 minute meeting where we discuss what we've done, what we're doing, and what is
blocking us from continuing our work. This builds team communication, improves team dynamics, and helps
improve game quality in the long run.

My Part:
--------------------------------------------------------
"Backend" is the loose term we used to describe my contribution to the game. In the early stages of the
game I created the State Machines that were used to handle GameStates and PlayerStates. This includes
the Player controller that contains the movement of the player on land and in water, as well as the
transitions between scenes, between cut-scenes, and between pausing. The StateMachines greatly helped
Rob(Audio) and Nicole(Animation) implement their work to the game. After the StateMachines I helped Nicole
create the Animation Controllers within Unity that handled animation transitions and script hookups. Before
Alpha stage playtesting I worked on scripting the tutorial AI character that helps walk the player through
the controls in the initial stages of the game and expands upon the story in the later stages. Lastly,
during the polish stages nearing beta and post-alpha, I worked on the GUI that can be seen in the Main Menu,
pause screen, and during the gameplay. I created 2 different custom fonts, with the help of our artist,
John, for use in the GUI and part of the narrative.
